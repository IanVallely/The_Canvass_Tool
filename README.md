# The_Canvass_Tool
An app developed to assist groups out canvassing specifically for Scottish Independence but may expand later to be a more generic tool.
The app is esigned to work without network connection using local storage and utilising the email intent to send collected data to
a set email address. on sending data the app cleans up by confirming email sent and backup created, on completion the app deletes 
the collected data file ready to start a new canvass session.
